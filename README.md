# Highfield Qualifications Task
## Chad Simpson

This project was created as a VS 2017 default ASP.NET Core Web App, so there is code unrelated to the task within the project. 

The relevant code is in the following files:
  * Task\Controllers\HomeController.cs
  * Task\Views\Home\Data.cshtml

When running the project, it should open a brower tab, and the relevant code is run by navigating to the "Data" link in the top nav.
